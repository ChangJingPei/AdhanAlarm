Introduction

In a busy world where there are many distractions, it would be nice if your cellphone could alert you when it's time to pray. Especially in western countries where the call to prayer is not publicly announced, this application can help Muslims establish prayer. The times for the five daily prayers are determined by the position of the sun, for example the noon prayer is established when the sun produces the shortest shadows of the day. Algorithms exist that can determine these times based on the latitude, longitude and a few other input parameters.
